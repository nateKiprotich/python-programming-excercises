# Python Programming Excercises

Over the course of more than *two* years, I have resolved countless times to practice programming on a daily basis.

I have made multiple  attempts on:

- 100 Days of Progamming
- 66 Days of code
- etc..

In this approach, I will attempt to practice as much as possible but be practical as well.
